I will update as new version each time I add 100 lines of code to the last version, also the versions that are already uploaded and published will not be updated, if there's a tweak I need to do for that version I will just upload as another version of that version I was trying to tweak. ex. ver 1.0 (Uploaded) -> ver 1.0.1 (pretty much the same as last version but with a little tweak)...<br/>
(yeah I had a hard time explaining that, hopefully its clear tho)

(also might need help in doing a few things cause im new to coding so pls help if you can thanks)
